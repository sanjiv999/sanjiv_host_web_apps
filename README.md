# 🚀 Sanjiv's Web Apps Collection

A collection of web applications created with Gemini Canvas to showcase my learning journey in web development.

## 📖 About

This repository hosts multiple HTML web applications that I've created while learning web development. Each app demonstrates different web technologies, concepts, and features.
